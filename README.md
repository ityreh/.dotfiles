This is an automated setup of my personal archlinux development environment configuration. Please use the sources here only to get inspiration and take them into your own setup instead of running the scripts as they are on your system, because they are tailored to me. If you want to automate the setup of your own environment, I highly recommend the book by [Matthieu Cneude](https://github.com/Phantas0s) called [Building your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themouseless.dev/).

## Installation

Use the `install.sh` script to setup the configuration on your system.

    bash install.sh

For the whole installation of my archlinux development environment have a look at [arch-install](https://github.com/ityreh/arch-install).
