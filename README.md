# dotfiles

Dotfiles and setup for my personalized setup. This project is highly inspired by [Matthieu](https://thevaluable.dev/) and I really recommend his articles. I had a similar setup (Arch, Zsh and i3) and extended it with his recommendations. Now I improve the setup for my own needs.

- System (ArchLinux)
- Shell (Zsh)
- Window Manager (i3)
- [Terminal Multiplexer (tmux)](#terminal-multiplexer-(tmux))
- Editor (Neovim)

## [Terminal Multiplexer (tmux)](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

Configuration of tmux with settings, keybindings and plugins.

```
tmux/tmux.conf -> ~/.tmux.conf
```

Sessions configuration for tmux can be done with [tmuxp](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/) writing your session information to a yaml file in `~/.tmuxp/`.
